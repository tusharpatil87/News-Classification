Goal of the Project: Classification of News with Machine Learning Model: In the era of internet and social media we have surrounded by n number of news. We are always searching for our favorite categories of News. Most of the News Websites, News editors are doing manual categorization of News into the different classes, Such as Sports, Entertainment, Business, Politics, Tech world..etc.. This takes long time and having threats of incorrect categorization. So, here is Machine Learning Algorithms which can help us to do this process automated. We will see how the Machine Learning would help us to News Categorization.
